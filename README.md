## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The process really boiled down to making a table header and row in html and then looping through the columns with JS to make a nice 6x5 table. Then fetching data from "JService.io" for all the questions and inputting them into each box. I used CSS for the 'jeopardy blue' design. I called the questions to the screen using js' 'alert'.

## Optimizations
*(Mobile version)*

If I have the time in the future I want to work on a mobile version for this app. 

## Lessons Learned:

Growing up I loved watching Jeopardy and during high school my teachers would use the jeopardy games where you insert the categories and write your own answers. Being able to build this has been monumental for me. The biggest lesson I learned doing this was that I LOVE API'S! .

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
